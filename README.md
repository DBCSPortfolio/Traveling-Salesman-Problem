# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
An implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem in Python for a package delivery scenario. This project was completed for a course on data structures and algorithms in Python.

The premise of this problem is that a number of packages need to be delivered to a variety of different locations, at a variety of different times. There are also constraints on the number of delivery trucks and drivers available, as well as specific requirements for package groupings. The goal of the project is to direct drivers as to how and when to deliver packages in order to meet all deadlines, all while traveling over as little distance as possible.
